Thinking is inherently tough because the brain needs to do more work. From an evolutionary lens, we’re designed to do less work or avoid working if feasible to save energy and survive. Unless you’re living below the poverty line in the modern world, you don’t need to save energy—but ensure that you don’t work yourself to exhaustion and that you rest and rejuvenate with sleep and recreational activities.

Instant availability of feel-good experiences: you have content everywhere in your life, with screens occupying most of your waking hours—and you’re habituated to it by the world around you, including the people you love. In my life, at least, it’s rare for me to have people who don’t binge on easy and feel-good short videos.

The combination is lethal for thinking hard and long: a) you have an evolutionary tendency to use less energy, and b) you have instant availability of feel-good experiences.

Thinking hard is still possible. But you have to be deliberate about it and expend more energy to navigate towards this activity. You have to design your habits, environment, and lifestyle around thinking hard. All of this needs effort, of which you only have a limited quantity in a day.

But, but, but why do I need to think hard? I’m thinking hard enough in my job to perform the tasks necessary. Can’t I just chill and have fun with feel-good content in my free time?

You can do that, but moderation is necessary.

You’re doing a job (or running a business) because you need to earn a living; otherwise, you’ll have hobbies—not a job.

The quality of your life depends on the quality of your decisions and your efforts.

Let me first get one thing clear, which is inspired by Mark Mason: you’ll feel pain and suffer no matter how you live your life. It’s a good idea to feel pain to achieve good things rather than live passively and feel pain for unworthy reasons.

That’s quite abstract.

Example: You binge eat food you like. You feel good. And then? You become overweight and suffer.

Or, you eat healthy food and don’t overeat. This might not feel good, but you’re building a healthy diet regime. 

In both cases, there’s discomfort and suffering. I hope you get my point.

On those lines, if you don’t think hard enough, someone else will do that thinking for you. Most of them are pseudo-experts, influencers, salespeople, and marketing ninjas who passively exploit you and don’t necessarily have your best interest at heart.

From a survival viewpoint, you want to make the best decisions for yourself, and that means thinking hard, putting effort into what matters, and spending money and time on what’s right for you.

Amid all the feel-good experiences, you live in an information-rich world. That means you can research and learn many things and basics on your own, which is what you mostly need to get started in the right direction and get help from trusted experts when needed.

Let me give you a head start: Learn how credit cards profit from you or people in general; you’ll be surprised how they exploit a fundamental psychological aspect, which, by the looks of credit card profits, only a few overcome.
