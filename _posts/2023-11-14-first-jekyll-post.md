Writing is hard not because a writer's job is merely to use the language in the written form but because the writer shall use the language creatively to put forth something interesting, insightful, engaging, and noteworthy.

With non-fiction writing, the biggest struggles are researching and finding insights worth presenting meaningfully. And imagination isn’t as necessary as in fiction writing. 

In fiction, ensuring uniqueness is easier than in non-fiction, which inherently is building original narratives from facts and opinions. Contrastingly, in fiction, the hard part is ensuring whatever is uniquely produced is interesting, and it is often the difference between earning success or just getting the scraps.

With fiction, the ability to infuse greater language skills and create worthy characters and the interplay is harder and harder and harder—also why writing fiction, like acting, is tough. But the ones who get it right will reap the rewards of the highest order.
